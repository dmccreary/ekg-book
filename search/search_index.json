A business vocabulary typically starts out with a flat list of terms in a spreadsheet. The terms are listed with their abbreviations and definitions and how they are used within a specific project or department. As vocabularies grow and mature the individual terms might be grouped together. These groupings become taxonomies and can then be used to automatcally classify documents with metadata tags of their preferred labels. Classified documents can have a dramatic increase on the search quality of a search engine. Concept An idea, a notion or a unit of thought. Concept elements are the fundamental unit of work in semantics. Each concept is usually associated with a preferred label in each language such as English, and it may have many alternate labels. Concepts are grouped together in Schemas and may be part of one or more Collections. Concept Reference on W3C SKOS Site Concept Graph A graph that stores the core business concepts of a project, department or enterprise. In the ideal world, an enterprise graph will use a combination of machine learning to connect related concepts together. Data Ingestion A process by which data is moved from one or more sources to a destination where it can be stored and further analyzed. The data might be in different formats and come from various sources, including RDBMS, other types of databases, S3 buckets, CSVs, or from streams. Departmental Graph A graph designed to store information from one or more departments of an enterprise. Departmental graphs may be limited in that they can't be scaled up to hold enterprise data. Data Layer Raw low-level binary codes that contains information after analysis. Dashboard A set of views, usually presented on a single page, that display information as a set of key performance indicators and charts. In general, dashboard views can be customized for a role or a specific user. DB Engines A web site that harvests web documents that discuss databases and classifies the documents based on a taxonomy of database types. The \"Popularity changes per category report\" is frequently cited in many graph presetations. DB Engines Embedding A data structure, usually a vector of decimal numbers, associated with an item in a graph, that helps users quickly find similar items. Vertices, Edges, and Paths may all have embeddings. Enterprise Knowledge Graph A scalable graph database system used to store large-scale connected information for an entire enterprise. By scalable we mean that it must be able to run on multiple servers as the graph expands. Without scalability the graph might be considered a project or departmental graph. For many large organizations, enterprise knowledge graphs typically have hundreds of developers doing concurrent loading and query development and the models can be dynamic. For example the Google Knowledge Graph team is thought to contain over 1,500 developers. Glossary A business vocabulary associated with a topic. A glossary often has both general definitions of terms as well as contextual definitions for a specific domain or project. See also: Business Vocabulary Graph Query Language A proposed standard graph query language being developed by the Working Group 3 (Database Languages) of ISO/IEC JTC 1's Subcommittee 32. GQL is designed to work with Labeled Property Graphs . Wikipedia GQL Page Graph Structured Query Language A distributed graph query language developed by TigerGraph. GSQL was designed to be syntactically similar to the SQL language but it also integrated distributed query concepts that share patterns similar to MapReduce queries. Also known as: GSQL Graph Database A way of storing information in terms of vertices and edges. Graph databases consider edge traversal as a primary performance consideration. By storing edges as in-memory pointers graph databases offer roughly a 1,000x performance improvement over relational database management JOIN operations that must be calculated for each query. See also: Index Free Adjacency Graph Isomorphism A graph can exist in different forms having the same number of vertices, edges, and also the same edge connectivity. Such graphs are called isomorphic graphs. Index Free Adjacency Information Layer Data about our key business entities. This includes Things, like People, Places and Events. Knowledge Layer A layer in the knowledge triangle that contains connected information. The knowledge layer is often the top layer in our views. There are some views that include a Wisdom layer on top of the knowledge layer. Knowledge Triangle A stack of three layers. At the base is the Data Layer , above that the Information Layer and at the top the Knowledge Layer . Labeled Property Graph A graph data model where each Vertex and Edge have a single type and goth Vertices and Edges have attributes. Both TigerGraph and Neo4j use the LPG data model. Also known as: LPG Load-As-Is Pattern A data loading pattern that loads the data into a graph with minimal transformation. Once the data is loaded into the graph the transformation is done in the native language of the graph such as GSQL. This pattern allows many projects to share the underlying data loaders and allows each team to customize the post-loading transformation using the native query language of the graph. The other major data model is the RDF model which is discouraged at Optum due to the challenges with Reification. Reification causes RDF SPARQL queries to be rewritten. Load-as-is pattern See also: RDF On-the-Wire vs. In-the-Can A way of looking at knowledge representation requirements in two domains. On-The-Wire implies that a serialization of a dataset must retain connection information within itself and to other external systems. In-The-Can implies that the representation is optimized for queryability and sustainability . RDF is optimized for On-The-Wire exchange of knowledge. LPG is optimized for In-The-Can tasks such as queryability and sustainability. Ontology A graph of Concepts within a specific domain. Ontologies often begin as flat term lists, that become taxonomies that then have more complex relationships than simple broader and narrower concepts. Ontologies are often stored in formats such as SKOS and OWL. Open vs Closed World https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-world_assumption https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-world_assumption Preferred Label A preferred lexical label associated with a Concept . In the SKOS standard, there should be one and only one preferred label per language per concept. Project Graph A graph that supports a specific project. Project graphs may contain knowledge that is not of interest to the rest of the enterprise. Reification Reification is the process by which an abstract idea about a computer program is turned into an explicit data model or other object created in a programming language. Specifically, in the RDF modeling process it is the process of adding an abstract vertex to a graph when properties are needed in a relationship. Reification causes queries that traverse that node to be rewritten. This means that SPARQL queries are inherently much more difficult to maintain than LPG graph queries. Resource Description Framework An early family of standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium for exchanging graph data championed by the Semantic Web community starting in 1999. RDF gained some traction around 2010 but failed to gain widespread adoption due to the complexity of the standards and the problems of Reification . Wikipedia Role-based Access Control The ability to assign access to a resource to individuals that have a specific role. For Enterprise Knowledge Graphs, there are both high-level subgraph rules and fine-grain rules such as vertex-related role-based access control. Semantics The branch of computer science associated with meaning. It can be best understood by understanding the semantic triangle. The key point of the semantic triangle is that we cannot directly associate a label with a referent without traversing concepts. Simple Knowledge Organizational System A model for expressing the basic structure and content of concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, folksonomies, and other similar types of controlled vocabularies. SKOS is also the name of the world-wide-web standard for encoding these systems. Serializations of SKOS are typically done in RDF format although other encodings such as XML and JSON are common. See Also: W3C SKOS Primer See Also: W2C SKOS Referecnce Sustainability The ability for a team of developers to maintain the code that supports an enterprise knowledge graph in the face of changes to the data model. The key measure is to avoide problems related to rewriting graph queries when small changes are made to the graph data model. Triple Store A purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of RDF triples through semantic queries. Triple stores are not used in most enterprise graphs due to their lack of sustanability due to problems with Reification . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore Web Ontology Language A Semantic Web language designed to represent rich and complex knowledge about things, groups of things, and relations between things.

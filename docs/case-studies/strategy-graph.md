# Strategy Graph

* Strategic planning is complex
* Funding the right projects
* Project dependency graphs
* Project dashboards

Strategic planning can be a complex process.  A CEO may get hundreds of annual project proposals all claiming to lower expenses, increase revenue or increase agility.  Many of these projects will claim to have high return on investments.  Perhaps they claim their new system will allow three old systems to be decommissioned or provide valuable new insight to trends existing systems.

In this chapter we will look at how an enterprise knowledge graph can be used to predict the actual savings of new projects, systems or initiatives based on three observations:

1. Strategic projects are not isolated silos.  Many depend on other projects being successful.  If projects can provide infrastructure to other projects they should be prioritized.  Thus a project dependency graph is a key aspect to strategic planning.
2. Projects are often similar to other projects that we may already have experience with.  By being able to find similar projects we can build better cost models by using data from prior projects.
3. The individuals that are assigned to projects also have a history on prior projects.  Building an accurate individual project histories can also aid in predicting a projects success and its return on investment.

## Using EKG to Build Project Dashboards

After an annual strategy has been announced there are many questions that a CEO may want to know about the status of a project and the individual actions that people are taking.  We can use EKGs to build dashboards that gather complex metrics from projects, team, tasks and communications to see how strategies are progressing.

## What is an HR Graph?

In the Novemberâ€“December 2018 issue Harvard Business Review published a high-level overview of the role of analytics in managing human resources.  Their article *Better People Analytics Measure who they know, not just who they are* showed that organizations that focused just on the attributes of an employee are losing out on key insights.  They define People Analytics as *using statistical insights from employee data to make talent management decisions*.

The article gives six:

1. **Ideation** - An employee signature
2. **Influence** - An employee signature
3. **Efficiency** - An team signature that can help predict if a team will finish projects on time
4. **Innovation** - An team signature that shows if a team will be able to adopt new ideas
5. **Silos** - An organization signature that shows whether an organization is isolated from other areas of a larger organization.
6. **Vulnerability** - An employee signature that shows which employees the organization would be costly to replace

What data does it contain?

* **Organization chart data** - what is the reporting structure of an organization?
* **Employee e-mails** - who is sending e-mails to who and what are the topics of each e-mail?
* **Employee meetings** - who is having meetings with who?
* **Project data** - how are people grouped into working teams?
* **Task data** - what tasks are assigned to what individuals?
* **Access data** - what internal systems does each employee have access to?
* **Desktop application logs** - what types of desktop applications do users use every day

In 1991 Geoffrey Moore wrote his groundbreaking book, [Crossing the Chasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm).  In this book Moore discussed the idea the [Technology Adoption Lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle) based on prior work in the [diffusion of innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations).



Moore's key insight was the key difference between why organization adopt new technologies.
Innovators and early adaptors focused on giving their organizations a competitive advantage using technology.  In contrast, early majority buyers are interested in lowering operational costs and need solid evidence that many similar organizations to their own have already reached uncontested cost savings.

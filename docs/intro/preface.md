# Preface

This book is my personal attempt to help people understand one of the most important developments in information technology: the rise of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.  I have spent most of my career helping organizations understand the strategic impact of various technologies.  In 2011, working with Tony Shaw at Dataversity, we created one of the first international conferences in matching business problems to the emerging market of NoSQL databases.  In 2014, working with my wife, Ann Kelly, we published our book ["Making Sense of NoSQL"](https://www.manning.com/books/making-sense-of-nosql) which became one of the highest-rated books on the topic of NoSQL databases.

Our NoSQL book was the first to propose a taxonomy of database architectures that are used to guide the solution matching process.  Graph databases were one of the six solutions we found that provided a unique set of value propositions.  However, at the time, graph databases didn't scale well to meet the demanding requirements of the enterprise.  The introduction of TigerGraph in 2017 started to change everything.  Now we had a graph database that truly could scale to meet the demanding needs of the enterprise.

After reading this book you will see that the Enterprise Knowledge Graph provides not just a strong return on investments today, but it will become the foundation that companies will build their organization's "knowledge brains" in the future.  Imagine opening a chatbot that knows everything about your company. All the customers, all the products, all the production flows, all the employees, all the training programs, all the documents, all the systems, all the key concepts, and all the trends.  The Enterprise Knowledge Graph is enabling all of these things today.

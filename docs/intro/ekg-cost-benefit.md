* Measuring EKG intangible benefits

When we build any large resource for an organization we are going to need to ask for money to build it.  If you work for a company like Apple and you are respected expert at building enterprise knowledge graphs, you many not need to go to a finance committee and justify your spending requests.  Apple hires world experts in specific fields and then trusts their judgement.  As long as you have a good track record they will keep giving you funding without asking a lot of questions.

But most of us don't work at Apple and we are not world leaders with a long successful track record of building EKGs.  We will have to fight for every penny we spend on our EKG pilot projects until the ROI is so clear to everyone that the finance people are begging you to expand the scope of the EKG.

Until that happens, we are going to need to learn to speak the language of finance to get our EKGs off the ground.

I want to express my gratitude to everyone within the Optum Advanced Technology Collaborative for helping me refine our storytelling strategies to our business areas.

Many other people have guided me in my journey in becoming a better storytelling driven solution architect.  They have taught me that is critical for us to understand both how technologies work, and to be able to relate the benefits with stories that our stakeholders will remember.

# Enterprise Knowledge Graph Timeline

* Putting graph representations of knowledge in historical context

Here is a timeline of some of significant events that have led to the creation of the enterprise knowledge graph.  We focus on how the representation of knowledge impacted the way that problems were solved.

## First Brain
Centralized nervous systems may have first evolved around 521 million years ago.  They probably evolved from simple [Nerve Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_net) which consisted of specialized cells that worked together to process information.  All networks that process information can be modeled by graph databases.

What is interesting to note is that higher life forms never have evolved information processing systems that use tabular data storage.  This is an artificial construct that evolved from writing systems.

## Cuniform Tablets
Around 3,000 BCE in the fertile crescent, a group of farmers started to record transactions as rows and columns in clay tablets.  Dispite its limitations in storing relationships, for the next 5,000 years, tabular representaion of data became the dominent way to store and transmit knowledge.

This was the first known case of persistent data representation.  Although the transactions were initially simple, they started in motion a long change of representing data in tabular structures.  A process that still exists today.

## Looms
Basile Bouchon developed the punch card as a control for looms in 1725.

## Punched Cards
In 1890 Herman Hollerith developed punched cards for use in commercial data processing.

## The Google Knowledge Graph
On May 16, 2012, Google published the "Things Not Strings" blog post.  Now the world knew that graphs were no longer an academic interest. Google's graph serviced millions of requests per minute and was available 24X7.  Knowlege Graphs became cool.

## What is Explainable AI

* Explainable systems are systems that can enumerate why they are creating specific recommendations
* Explainable systems answer the question "why"
* Explainable systems provide explanations in ways that humans can quickly understand
* Explainable systems provide evidence and references
* Explainable systems can show the linage and provenance of the source data used to make decisions
* Explainable systems describe alternatives
* Explainable systems promote trust
* Explainable systems encourage feedback when assumptions are incorrect
* Explainable systems are easy to correct
* Explainable systems give clear probability analysis

# Graph Machine Learning

A machine learning robot walks into a bar.
<br/>The bartender asks, *"What'll you have?"*
<br/>The machine learning robot says, *"What's everyone else having?"*

This chapter covers the following topics:

* What is graph machine learning?
* How is graph machine learning different from standard machine learning?
* What is structural analysis?  Why do flat files not contain structure?
* How does structure inform insight?
* What are the key graph machine learning algorithms
* Graph convolutional neural networks
